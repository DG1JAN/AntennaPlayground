# DL1HBTUnUn

Based on the UniBalun Project, a modification requested from Tom (DL1HBT).

The BNC connector can be found here:  https://amzn.eu/d/83ZCG39 

This 1:49 UnUn can be direct connected to the TRX output Jack. 

Due to the missing coax Feedline it is recomendet to use a counterpoise with min. 0.05 of the maximum used wave length.
