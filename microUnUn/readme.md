# MicroUnUn
a PCB for a very lightweight qrp (maximum 10W SSB & CW or 5W on FT8) 1:49 UnUn

BOM:
- Amdion FT82-43 (FairRite 5943000601)
- 1m Enamel-coated copper wire (0.5mm to 0.7mm will be OK)
- 100pF Capaciator SMD 605 Type
- PCB-Edge Mount SMA Plug (also Socket for direct connection to the radio will work, but use a wire as counterpoise in this case!)
- 2mm "gold" Bana Plug 


You can also test a combination of FairRite 59430000601 and 5943001101 Torroids (see Pictzre below), According my measuremenst this results in a ~10% improved efficency over a FT82-43 or FT114-43). If you like pls have a look to my report:
